This perl script identifies if any of the sites name present in the second file exist in the first file.

This pers script requires two files.
First file name is 'keywords_out.txt'. 
The content of this file is sites name followed by a tab and then followed by some word. (This was my use case)
Second file is 'input.txt'.
The content of this file is simply the name of sites, each on new line.

This script outputs using Dumper.
The first output is Dump of which sites are present in the second file is also present in the first file.
And second output dump is of which sites from the second file are not present in the first file.

Later, I am also printing the count respectively.
